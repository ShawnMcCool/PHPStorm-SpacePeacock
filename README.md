PHPStorm-SpaceCock
==================

An attempt at a decent PHPStorm setup based on [SpaceGray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) and [Peacocks in Space](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes/blob/master/PeacocksInSpace.tmTheme).

# Color Theme

Definitely use this with the Darcula theme. Unfortunately, a fundamental lack of customization in PHPStorm prevents me from being able to clean up the awful looking icons in the project bar, or adjust the colors in any way.

The syntax color scheme has only been designed for 'general' and 'PHP', so far. I'll be updating HTML etc eventually.

The color scheme is based on a combination of SpaceGray for Sublime Text and Peacocks in Space for Sublime Text.

# Key Maps

The key mapping has been updated to better fit Sublime Text conventions. Because, I didn't think that ctrl + shift + alt + t was a reasonable combination for Refactor This...

ctrl + p search everywhere

ctrl + r search methods in current file

ctrl + alt + p change projects

ctrl + shift + enter finish statement

alt + enter solve issue (whatever it's called)

ctrl + alt + enter refactor this

There are others, as I think of them, I'll add them here.
